            <h1>About</h1>
                <p id="about">
                Hello site visitor.
                I do not know what has led you here, but since you arrived this gives me the chance to introduce myself.
                My name is Josh, and I am currently a PhD Candidate at the University of Virginia studying astrochemistry.
                I originally am from the beautiful and rugged state of West Virginia, growing up immersed in the hills and hardwood forests of the Appalachian Mountains.
                This where I attended two undergraduate instutions: Potomac State College and West Virginia University.
                There my interests grew for physical chemistry and where I involved myself in research involving both observational astronomy and kinetics of radicals at high temperatures.
                Post graduation from WVU, I was accepted to the PhD Program in Chemistry at the University of Virginia.
                Currently, I work in the Herbst Lab studying the formation of organic molecules in cold regions of interstellar space.
                This has involved using astrochemical codes to understand how certain formation routes contribute to the molecular inventory observed from Earth and currently also using deep learning techniques to increase the extent of our current chemical networks.
                <br>
                <br>
                When I am not working on research, my days are filled with my endless number of hobbies.
                I enjoy reading fantasy books, mostly those that involve Tolkien's legendarium, and textbooks mostly around concepts in physical chemistry.
                You will also find me in the outdoors where I enjoy fishing, hunting, hiking, and backpacking where I love taking pictures.
                Making many different foods and materials also peak my interest.
                This includes making homemade cleaning supplies, cooking, especially bread baking, and my newest hobby: homebrewing.
                My grandfather used to make homemade wine which was inherited by my father.
                And now I have delved into the lovely craft of brewing mead.
