                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>I am from the beautiful yet rugged state of West Virginia and grew up immersed in the hardwoods of the Appalachian Mountains. This where I attended two undergraduate instutions: Potomac State College and West Virginia University. There my interests grew for physical chemistry and involved myself in research involving both observational astronomy and kinetics of radicals at high temperatures. Post graduation from WVU, I was accepted to the Phd Program in Chemistry at the University of Virginia. Currently, I work in the Herbst Lab for Professor Eric Herbst where I have studied the formation of oxygen bearing organic molecules on interstellar ices using astrochemical code Nautilus. And now I use natural language processing techniques to create tools to aid in the creation of chemical reaction networks that are used in our kinetic models. While here at UVa, I also discovered a strong passion for teaching undergraduates as a teaching assistant for the physical chemistry lab.</p>
