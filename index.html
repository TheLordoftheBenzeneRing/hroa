            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                I am from the beautiful yet rugged state of West Virginia and grew up immersed in the hardwoods of the Appalachian Mountains.
                This where I attended two undergraduate instutions: Potomac State College and West Virginia University.
                There my interests grew for physical chemistry and involved myself in research involving both observational astronomy and kinetics of radicals at high temperatures.
                Post graduation from WVU, I was accepted to the Phd Program in Chemistry at the University of Virginia.
                Currently, I work in the Herbst Lab for Professor Eric Herbst where I have studied the formation of oxygen bearing organic molecules on interstellar ices using astrochemical code Nautilus.
                And now I use natural language processing techniques to create tools to aid in the creation of chemical reaction networks that are used in our kinetic models. While here at UVa, I also discovered a strong passion for teaching undergraduates as a teaching assistant for the physical chemistry lab.

                <h2>Photon-Induced Surface Reactions</h2>
                <p>
                    The interstellar medium is populated with large amounts of micron sized dust grains composed of silicaceous and carbonaceous material.
                    In cold sources, the low temperature causes gaseous compounds to accrete onto the grain surfaces, forming rich layers of mostly water, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and trace amounts of organic molecules.
                    During cloud collapse these grains and icy mantles warm-up allowing for efficient diffusion for increased reactivity and desorption back into the gas.
                    For many years this explained the increased complexity observed in warm sources but recent detections have shown a large amount of molecular complexity on cold clouds pre-collapse.
                    To aid in explaining this phenomenon, I used a large chemical kinetic solver, Nautilus, to add an experimentally observed surface reaction induced by radiating the surface with ultraviolet photons.
                    The photons cause photodesorption of small molecules such as molecular oxygen and carbon dioxide and can produced oxygen atoms in the electronically excited <sup>1</sup>D state.
                    These atoms possess increased reactivity compared to their ground <sup>3</sup>P state allowing for an immediate reaction with nearby neighbors on or in the ice mantle without prohibiting reactive barriers.
                    By including such reactions with common hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, ethylene and acetylene), it produces oxygen bearing organics that can then reactively desorb from the surface and into the gas for detection.

                <h2>Reaction Prediction with Deep Learning Techniques</h2>
                <p>
                    Traditional chemical modelling for astrochemical purposes involves either utilizing experimental results and quantum chemical calculations or using chemical intuition.
                    While using quantum chemistry and realistic experimental data is preferred, both require specialized knowledge and large amounts of time to complete.
                    Therefore, chemical intuition has become a standard in adding new reactions in chemical networks which are typically based on similar reactions already present in the data.
                    This method should involve a certain level of experience to make knowledgable additions and can be inherently biased depending on the purpose of the proposed reactions.
                    And with an increasing need for larger additions to networks due to more molecules being detected, these additions are a significant time crunch.
                    With the emmergence of powerful machine learning tools, we are instead trying to using AI to make these predictions for us.
                    The task of reaction prediction is known to be useful in the context of organic chemistry with the idea of finding novel drug synthesis pathways, and therefore should be able to show similar performance for the context of astrochemical synthetic pathways.
                    We currently utilizing the Transformer architecture to complete this task similar to machine translation where the model is given a pair of reactants and asked to predict the different product channels.
